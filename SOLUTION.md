using async/await to wrap the onquerychange method in the autocomplete component class, enabled the component to recieve data from apis and static json files simultaneously

i used github's search api to request user data asynchronously based on the data input from the search box, which i then parsed while making the request 

i also tested if the component was reusable by initializing another search box component, in the index.js and index.html file
